This article is about expanding environmental monitoring capabilities with free imagery and Google Earth Engine.
My research team developed and continues to host an online User Library at https://labs.wsu.edu/ecology/research-projects/cbem-user-library
for those who would like to learn about using Google Earth Engine for routine environmental monitoring.

From the User Library, you can access the full text article and a tutorial for cover change classification in Google Earth Engine.
