I analyze natural and social aspects of landscapes to identify promising approaches for addressing challenges in environmental conservation, with a focus on multiple-use or working lands. My research often involves the development of mapping techniques (using GIS and remote sensing) to inform strategic planning or effectiveness monitoring for conservation measures at site to large-landscape scales. Where possible, I use freely available or low-cost data and techniques to develop maps or tools that agencies, non-governmental organizations, or individuals can use to inform their decision-making in a landscape context. Current project topics include <a href="https://environment.wsu.edu/post-fire-management/">climate-adaptive post-fire forest recovery</a>, watershed-scale ecosystem monitoring in agricultural areas, and multi-scale mapping of wildlife habitat characteristics across landscapes.

My research team developed and continues to host an online User Library for those who would like to learn about using Google Earth Engine for routine environmental monitoring: <a href="https://labs.wsu.edu/ecology/research-projects/cbem-user-library/">https://labs.wsu.edu/ecology/research-projects/cbem-user-library/</a>
